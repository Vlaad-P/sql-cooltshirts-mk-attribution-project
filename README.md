# sql-cooltshirts-mk-attribution-project

Here is my take on Codeacademy SQLite project named CoolTShirts. CoolTShirts is an innovative apparel shop, which is running a bunch of marketing campaigns.The exercise has two main goals. 

First goal is to understand the typical user journey on CoolTShirts website, by analysing first and last touches and which marketing campaigns were responsible for most purchases.

Second goal is campaign budget optimisation, based on the findings from the first goal. CoolTShirt seek advise on which five campaigns to reinvest in.

The repository includes a sqlite db project file and a PowerPoint presentation.

Please feel free to explore and share. Any feedback is much appreciated.

Enjoy!
